                    <p>When it comes time to shop for a new pad, I go for Organic.  Crash pads are cheaper than injuries, and the foam, comfort, and custom color scheme is worth it. 
                        But I have always struggled to envision color schemes, so I thought it would be cool to put this site together to help myself and others. 
                        I took some of the web development skills I have been building to create this simple site.  I hope you are able to find an inspiring color scheme for your next pad!</p>

                    <p>I have has been climbing since about 2012, and am now based in the Tahoe area.  I love bouldering and multi-pitch climbing, so the tall, adventurous boulders blend the best of both worlds.</p>
                    <p>I get psyched that Organic makes products which it easier to tackle the best and tallest boulders.</p>
